to deploy the project u have to run both - the backend and the frontend side.

the back: https://github.com/yosefus/react-to-do-list-simpe-back
the front: https://github.com/yosefus/react-to-do-list-simpe-front

also u have to create .env file on the backend. with secret field, conection string field (to your mongo account) , port, and string auth - to confirm that the api req is from a browser.
